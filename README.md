# SOL CSS

CSS without the FUSS

SOL is a drop-in set of classless styles for your project. 

SOL comes in 3 flavors. Choose your own adventure.

1. **Just the reset**  
A compilation of primitive styles from other resets like Andy Bell and Open Props. All rules are defined within `:where()` for easy overrides.  
[Use the reset](https://github.com/djmtype/sol-css/blob/main/build/sol.reset.css)

1. **A solid base**  
Builds upon the reset, plus includes a theme layer for colors, typography, spacing, and light/dark schemes all defined by custom properties.  
[Use the base](https://github.com/djmtype/sol-css/blob/main/build/sol.base.css)

1. **The full package**    
Includes the base foundation and styles for most browser-shipped HTML elements like forms, dialog, details/summary, progress, and table.  
[Use the full package](https://github.com/djmtype/sol-css/blob/main/build/sol.css) or [Use the compressed full package](https://github.com/djmtype/sol-css/blob/main/build/sol.min.css)
